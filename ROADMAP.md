# ROADMAP.md

## Roadmap Principle

Build **wooord** milestone by milestone.

Each milestone should leave the app in a usable or clearly inspectable state.

Avoid large unfinished rewrites.

Prefer simple working features over complex abstractions.

Manual code changes are authoritative, even when this roadmap has not yet caught up. Inspect the current implementation before starting a milestone, and preserve intentional current behavior unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

Codex should stop after each milestone and wait for the next instruction.

---
## Codex Workflow Rule

When the user says `continue`, Codex should implement the next unfinished milestone in this file.

Codex should work in milestone order.

Do not skip ahead unless all earlier milestones are already fully implemented.

At the start of each run, inspect the current project state and determine the first milestone whose acceptance criteria are not fully satisfied.

Implement that milestone completely.

After finishing, stop and wait for the next `continue` instruction.

## Post-MVP Feature: Voice Settings and Dutch Audio

Status: Complete.

Goal: improve audio playback by allowing the user to choose voices for both Chinese and Dutch.

Build:

- Settings page
- route to Settings page
- navigation link to Settings page
- browser voice loading through the Web Speech API
- Chinese voice selection
- Dutch voice selection
- persisted selected voice preferences
- Chinese playback using the selected Chinese voice
- Dutch playback using the selected Dutch voice
- audible Dutch words in the file view
- support for Taiwan Chinese voices when available, especially `zh-TW`
- support for Dutch voices when available, especially `nl-NL` and `nl-BE`

Rules:

- Use installed browser/device voices from `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()`.
- Do not use a paid TTS API.
- Do not add a backend.
- Do not make external network calls for audio.
- If the selected voice is unavailable later, fall back to the best available language match.
- Chinese fallback order should prefer `zh-CN`, then `zh-TW`, then `zh-HK`, then any `zh-*` voice.
- Dutch fallback order should prefer `nl-BE`, then `nl-NL`, then any `nl-*` voice.
- The Settings page should clearly show voice name and language code.
- The Dutch word and Chinese translation should both be audible from the opened file page.

Acceptance criteria:

- user can open Settings
- user can choose a Chinese voice
- user can choose a Dutch voice
- selected voices persist after refresh
- Chinese audio uses the selected Chinese voice when available
- Dutch audio uses the selected Dutch voice when available
- Taiwan Chinese voices are selectable when the browser exposes them
- Dutch words in vocabulary entries are listenable
- app remains runnable

## Milestone 13: Stable Settings Numbers and Chinese Audio Text Handling

Status: Planned.

Goal: make every setting easy to reference and let the user choose whether Chinese audio uses the existing text-splitting behavior.

Build in one implementation pass:

- Show a visible setting number before every setting label in the Settings UI.
- Treat setting numbers as stable identifiers: do not derive them from array position and do not renumber existing settings when settings are later added, removed, or reordered.
- Assign the current settings these stable numbers:
  - `1` — UI language
  - `2` — Dutch audio source
  - `3` — Chinese audio source
  - `4` — Dutch voice
  - `5` — Chinese voice
- Add setting `6` — Chinese audio text splitting.
- Persist setting `6` with the existing audio/voice preferences in browser `localStorage`.
- Default setting `6` to enabled when no saved value exists, preserving the current behavior for existing users.
- When enabled, Chinese playback must process the original text with `splitChineseAudioText` and continue the current per-entry cycling behavior.
- When disabled, Chinese playback must pass the original, unsplit Chinese text through the audio playback flow.
- Apply the setting consistently to Chinese playback in both the opened file view and flashcards.
- Make Chinese audio preloading follow the same enabled/disabled text choice so Wiktionary lookup/cache preparation matches the text that will be played.
- Add localized Chinese and English labels/help text for the new setting and accessible UI semantics for its control.

Implementation notes from the current code:

- `src/features/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` currently renders five settings in the numbering order above.
- `src/features/settings/voicePreferences.ts` owns the `wooord.voicePreferences` local-storage object and already tolerates missing preference fields; extend that shape without discarding existing saved fields.
- `splitChineseAudioText` currently splits on the Chinese comma `，` and returns trimmed, non-empty parts (or the original text as fallback).
- `src/features/files/FileViewPage.tsx` and `src/features/files/FlashcardsPage.tsx` call `splitChineseAudioText` unconditionally and keep a per-entry next-part index. Both call sites must honor setting `6`.
- `preloadVocabularyAudios` in `src/features/files/audioService.ts` also splits Chinese text unconditionally; it must honor the same setting.
- The underlying `speakChinese`/`playLanguageAudio` path receives the text chosen by those callers and supports either browser speech or Wiktionary-with-browser fallback.

Acceptance criteria:

- all six Settings controls display their assigned numbers visibly
- the assigned numbers remain fixed in source rather than changing with render order
- the Chinese audio text splitting choice persists after refresh
- users with no saved choice retain the current split-and-cycle behavior
- enabled mode uses `splitChineseAudioText` for Chinese playback and preloading
- disabled mode plays and preloads the original Chinese text without splitting
- file-view and flashcard Chinese playback both follow the saved choice
- existing UI language, audio-source, and voice preferences continue to load and save
- the app remains mobile-friendly, accessible, and runnable

Stop after this milestone.

## Milestone 14: Automatic Flashcard Prompt Audio

Status: Complete.

Goal: automatically play the visible prompt when a flashcard is presented while keeping answer playback user-controlled.

Build:

- In Flashcard mode, automatically start the prompt-side audio whenever a card's prompt is displayed.
- Auto-play the first card's prompt after the flashcard file has loaded.
- Auto-play the new prompt after moving to the previous or next card.
- Auto-play the current card's new prompt after changing flashcard direction.
- Use Dutch audio for a Dutch prompt and Chinese audio for a Chinese prompt.
- Chinese prompt auto-play must follow the Chinese audio text handling preference from Milestone 13.
- Keep the existing prompt audio button visible and usable so the user can replay the prompt manually.
- Do not automatically play the answer when it is revealed or otherwise displayed.
- Keep the existing answer audio button available for manual playback.
- Avoid duplicate automatic playback caused by React rerenders or unrelated state changes.
- Preserve the existing active-audio state and graceful behavior when browser audio is unavailable.

Implementation notes from the current code:

- `src/features/files/FlashcardsPage.tsx` already has `playPromptAudio` and `playAnswerAudio` paths and tracks the current card, direction, reveal state, and active audio ID.
- Automatic playback should be tied to a meaningful prompt presentation change, not to every render.
- Navigation wraps or exits through the existing end-of-deck confirmation flow; only a card that is actually displayed should trigger prompt audio.

Acceptance criteria:

- the first displayed flashcard prompt plays automatically
- each newly displayed previous or next prompt plays automatically
- changing direction automatically plays the newly displayed prompt in the correct language
- revealing the answer never starts answer audio automatically
- prompt and answer audio buttons remain visible and work manually
- Chinese prompt playback follows the saved split/original-text preference
- rerenders do not cause repeated or overlapping unintended auto-play
- audio unavailability does not block flashcard study
- the app remains mobile-friendly and runnable

Stop after this milestone.
